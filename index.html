<h3>
    It started with cars and now its moved onto computers.  I'm here for the long haul.  I may just be starting out in my coding career but I won't stop advancing until i can do everything from A-Z.  I don't like things to be good enough, I like them to be all that they can be.  Find the limit and tread right on the line.

<h3>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first favorite book was in the 3rd grade and it was called “The Big Book of How Things Worked”.  From space shuttles to zippers that book had everything.  When I got older I started to notice cars and back then cars still meant freedom.  Then the only thing that I focused on was cars and bikes and how they did all the things they did.  Like turn gasoline into horsepower.  Or how the wipers never hit each other at any speed.  In the next decade I became a master automotive technician.  Things have changed, now cars are being run by computers.  The new Teslas are pretty much big computers on wheels.  That's when I started to get curious, what is it that makes computers work?  That question was like opening Pandora's box, coding has taken over now.  My bookshelf filled with automotive textbooks started to get company from books on coding.  One day i'm going to have my house holiday lights flashing and dancing to music like you see on youTube.  I have apps that I think will make my life easier that im learning to code, and from what I can see the potential is as high as the sky.
