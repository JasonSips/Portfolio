    <h3>A short about me</h3>
    <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From under the hood to behind a computer, my collar may have changed but my drive to
      continue advancing has
      not. I got my undergraduate degree for Automotive Technology but before even high school I tried to get a job
      working on cars or bikes. Old dirt bikes were more fun than hammy down computer parts in those days. Over the next
      14 years I went from sweeping the floors to team leader and service manager. It was fulfilling to climb through
      the rankings in the automotive world but also upsetting to see how poorly master technicians age in the automotive
      world. Now I decided to leave that world behind me to find new greater frontiers. It's a little scary closing a
      chapter of your life and starting a new one but looking at how far I came in 14 years, it's hard to contemplate
      how far I could go in the next 14 years.
